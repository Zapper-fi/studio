## Description

Zapper Studio is a platform which enables developers in our community to integrate Web3 applications into Zapper. Integrations can support fetching tokens and contract positions, retrieving a wallet's balances, calculating TVL, and more to come in the future. These adapters enrich the Zapper API, and all of its consumers, including our own mobile and web apps.
